It's a more powerful context-tracker for the state of variable declarations and assignments. It is to a parser what acceleration is to velocity, effectively a derivative:\r\n\r\n| Compiler | Geography | Math |\r\n|----------|-----------|------|\r\n| Lexer    | Position  | ƒ    |\r\n| Parser   | Velocity  | ƒ'   |\r\n| Interstate | Acceleration | ƒ'' |\r\n\r\nFeatures of Interstate:\r\n\r\n- Tracks creation and destruction of scopes\r\n- Auto-generates functions and classes in relevant scope\r\n- Tracks object inheritance\r\n- Tracks creation, assignment, and reference of variables, functions, and classes\r\n- Raises compile-time exceptions when variable, function, or class is used improperly\r\n- Enforces proper arguments for function calls\r\n- Enforces proper returns for function calls\r\n- Allows enforcing a specific subset of permitted types for each variable\r\n- Resolves return signatures for function calls at compile time\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n\tnpm install interstate-js\r\n",
